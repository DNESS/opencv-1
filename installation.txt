Tutorial on how to install OpenCV on 64bit Linux Ubuntu 13.04 . One of many tutorials to come.

OpenCV was designed for computational efficiency and with a strong focus on real-time applications. Written in optimized C/C++, the library can take advantage of multi-core processing. Adopted all around the world, OpenCV has more than 47 thousand people in their user community and estimated number of downloads exceeding 6 million. Usage ranges from interactive art, to mines inspection, stitching maps on the web or through advanced robotics.

Source Code Steps For Installation
1. Download Scipy Stack:

 	sudo apt-get update
 	sudo apt-get upgrade   

	sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib ipython 
        ipython-  notebook python-pandas python-sympy python-nose

2. Download opencv:

	# install basic development environment
 
	sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake pkg-config

	# install opencv dependencies. ubuntu 13.04 ships with opencv
  	# 2.4.2, which is close enough to 2.4.6 to pull in most of the
	# needed dependencies. If you still need the source code to get it,  try to download it and extract it by
	 following the following link:
	 
	wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/opencvlibrary/opencv-unix/2.4.6/OpenCV-2.4.6.tar.bz2

 	sudo apt-get build-dep libopencv-dev

 	# additional dependencies for java support

 	sudo apt-get install default-jdk ant

 	# for opengl support

	sudo apt-get install libgtkglext1-dev

	# compile opencv

 	tar xzvf opencv-2.4.6.1.tar.gz
	cd opencv-2.4.6.1
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D INSTALL_C_EXAMPLES=ON  
        -D INSTALL_PYTHON_EXAMPLES=ON -D BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON 
        -D WITH_QT=ON -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local 
        -D WITH_OPENGL=ON -D WITH_V4L=ON 
        -D BUILD_NEW_PYTHON_SUPPORT=ON -D WITH_TBB=ON ..

	make
	sudo make install


 	sudo nano /etc/ld.so.conf.d/opencv.conf
 	/usr/local/lib
 	sudo ldconfig
	sudo nano /etc/bash.bashrc
 	PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
	export PKG_CONFIG_PATH

	cd ~/OpenCV-2.4.6/samples/c
	chmod +x build_all.sh
	./build_all.sh
 
	#try the examples and make sure they work
  
	python ~/OpenCV-2.4.6/samples/python2/turing.py
